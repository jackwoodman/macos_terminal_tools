# macos_terminal_tools
Some helpful python programs to do commonly used macOS stuff that usually need you to dig through System Prefs.
Ideally you would run these using an Automator App/Quick Action, or a Terminal alias!

## lowPowerToggle.py
 - running this script will toggle between low power and not low power
 - you'll need to replace the PASSWORD HERE string on line 9 with your own password - obviously storing password in plain txt is not ideal
 - set TERMINAL_FEEDBACK to True if you're going to run this script via command line, and want string output as feedback

## darkModeToggle.py
 - pretty simple and pretty hacky: running this script will toggle between light and dark mode
